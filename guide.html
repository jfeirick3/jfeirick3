			<p>Yahtzee is a game that requires equal parts luck and skill</p>
			<h2>Pre-Game</h2>
			<p>When you start Yahtzee, you will have to enter some information.</p>
			<p>The first thing you need to do is decide how many people you are playing the game with.</p>
			<ul>The rules for player count are as follows:
				<li>There must be at least one player.</li>
				<li>There cannot be more than 4 players.</li>
				<li>Any invalid response, such as a number less than 1 or greater than 4, or a response that isn't a number will result in the player count automatically being set to 2.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>After deciding how many players there will be, you must enter names for each player.</p>
			<ul>The rules for naming are as follows:
				<li>The name must be at least 1 characters in length.</li>
				<li>The name cannot be longer than 10 characters.</li>
				<li>Your name may not comtain a comma.</li> 
			</ul>
			<p>After you give a name to all players, you must decide which mode to play on. The differences between game modes are explained at the bottom of the page.</p>
			<h3>How to Play</h3>
			<p>The person with the most points at the end of 13 rounds wins the game!</p>

			<p>Points can be obtained by filling the requirements for one of thirteen boxes. Each box can only be used once.</p>
			<h4>Upper row</h4>
			<p>The entire upper row of boxes follows the same set of rules. </p>
			<p>The score you gain is equal to the sum of your dice faces that have the specified number. For example:</p>
			<img src="YahtzeeStraight.PNG" width="441" height="50" alt="Dice. Faces in order are 5,3,4,6,6" >
			<p>If the player scored using the 'Six' box, they would earn 6 + 6 points.</p>
			<h5>Lower row</h5>
			<p>Three and Four Of a Kind: The points you earn is equal to the sum of all of your dice. Three/Four of these dice must have the same number of pips.</p>
			<p>Full House: You must have 3 of one number and 2 of another. Score: 25</p>
			<p>Small and Large Straight: A straight is a sequence of consecutive die faces; a small straight is 4 consecutive faces, and a large straight is 5 consecutive faces. The dice do not need to be in any specific orientation. Score: 30 (small straight) or 40 (large straight)</p>
			<p>Chance: The score you earn is the sum of your dice.</p>
			<p>Yahtzee: A 'Yahtzee' in this game is a five-of-a-kind. Score: 50</p>
			<h6>Different Game Modes</h6>
			<p>There are currently three modes: Normal, Competitive, and Super Competitive.</p>
			<p>Scoring is the same no matter what gamemode you play on.
			<p>In Competitive mode, after a player has finished their turn, they choose to block one of the remaining boxes for the next player</p>
			<p>When a box is blocked, a player cannot score using that box for that turn.</p>
			<p>In Super Competitive mode, the effect is different. Selecting a box forces the next player to score using that box.</p>
