			<p>This is a recreation of Yahtzee, published on trinket.io, and coded with PyGame!</p>
			<ul>The main difference between this and normal yahtzee is the inclusion of two extra modes besides the base game:
				<li>Competitive mode, in which after each player is done with their turn, they get to block the next player from scoring on a chosen tile for their turn.</li>
				<li>Super Competitive mode, which plays like the opposite of Competitive mode. Instead of blocking a tile for the next player, you force the next player to roll for that tile.</li>
			<p>There are differences between almost all forms of yahtzee, so check out my guide!</p>
